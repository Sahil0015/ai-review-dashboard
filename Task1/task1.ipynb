      "0  An upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me. I planned my visit for a quieter evening, and reviewed the menu again and again. \\n\\nHowever, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy, and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory. \\n\\n\\nWe were seated immediately. \\n\\nOur waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is). \\n\\nHalfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls. \\n\\nWhen the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately, we took our grub with us.\\nI had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily. Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal, though, we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand. \\n\\nNormally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right, but since I am recommending that you not go there, why bother?      1\n",

Unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least. We came in on a 3pm on Saturday and there was only one other couple inside. We were literally outnumbered by the people working there. I say this because somehow, despite this fact, the service was HORRENDOUS. I mean we got our order out fine, but our waitress dissappeared after that. At one point I had to almost get refills for us myself. The sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was. The Philadelphia roll was decent, but the California roll was really bad. When it came to paying, I put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile. Despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table, the waitress didn't return. If it wasn't for the cash I had on me I'd be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!      1\n",
